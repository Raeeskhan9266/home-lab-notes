# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) — PortSwigger Web Security Academy

Tracking hands-on labs completed for the XSS topic, following the same
methodology used for SQL Injection: understanding the vulnerability,
constructing the payload, and documenting the underlying technique.

## Lab 1: Reflected XSS into HTML Context with Nothing Encoded

Topic: Cross-Site Scripting | Difficulty: Apprentice

## Vulnerability
The search functionality takes user input (the search term) and reflects
it directly back into the HTML of the response page — without encoding or
sanitizing any special characters. This means any HTML or JavaScript
submitted in the search box gets rendered and executed directly by the
browser, exactly as if it were part of the page's original code.

## What is Reflected XSS?
Reflected XSS occurs when user-supplied input is immediately echoed back
in the server's response, without being stored anywhere. The malicious
script only executes when a specific crafted request/link is used — unlike
Stored XSS, where the payload is saved on the server and affects every user
who later views the page.

## Steps Taken
1. Entered the following payload into the search box:
<script>alert(1)</script>
2. Clicked "Search"

## How the Payload Works
Since the application inserts the search term directly into the HTML
response without encoding characters like `<` and `>`, the browser
interprets `<script>alert(1)</script>` as literal HTML/JavaScript rather
than plain text. This causes the browser to execute the enclosed
JavaScript (`alert(1)`), popping up an alert box — proving that arbitrary
JavaScript can be injected and executed in the context of the page.

## Result
Successfully triggered the `alert(1)` popup, confirming the reflected XSS
vulnerability and solving the lab.

## What I Learned
This lab demonstrated the most fundamental form of XSS: when input is
reflected into an HTML context with zero encoding, injecting a `<script>`
tag directly is often all that's needed. In a real attack, this same
technique could be used to steal cookies/session tokens, redirect users to
malicious sites, or perform actions on behalf of the victim — the `alert()`
call here is simply a safe, standard proof-of-concept used to demonstrate
that arbitrary script execution is possible. This connects conceptually to
the SQL injection labs: in both cases, the root cause is the same pattern —
user input being trusted and inserted directly into a context (SQL query
or HTML page) without proper sanitization or encoding.
